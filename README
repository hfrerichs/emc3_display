How to install the progam:

1.) Copy/unpack all program files to a directory of your choice. This
    directory is called MY_DIR for later reference.

2.) You might want to run emc3_display from any directory (e.g. because
    emc3_display will automatically select the data from the local
    directory), so either add MY_DIR to the PATH environment variable or
    link emc3_display.sh to some directory in $PATH.

3.) The default base directory for simulations is
    $HOME/modeling/edge_transport
    A differing directory name can be set in the file "config" by
    the sim_dir variable. The expected structure in the simulation directory is:
    MACHINE_NAME/CONFIGURATION_NAME/CASE_NAME/RUN_NAME
    e.g.
    DIII-D/160884_5000ms_2fluid/nin_23/iteration42
