How to install the progam:

1.) Copy/unpack all program files to a directory of your choice. This
    directory is called MY_DIR for later reference.

2.) You might want to run emc3_display from any directory (e.g. because
    emc3_display will automatically select the data from the local
    directory), so either add MY_DIR to the PATH environment variable or
    link emc3_display.sh to some directory in $PATH.

3.) The default directory is $HOME/sandbox/emc3_display. If you have
    chosen another directory, replace
    EMC3_DISPLAY_DIR=$HOME/sandbox/emc3_display
    with
    EMC3_DISPLAY_DIR=MY_DIR
    in emc3_display.sh, so that IDL will find the program files.

4.) The default base directory for simulations is
    $HOME/modeling/edge_transport
    A differing directory name can be set in $EMC3_DISPLAY_DIR/config by
    the sim_dir variable. The expected simulation directory structure is:
    $HOME/$sim_dir/MACHINE_NAME/CONFIGURATION_NAME/CASE_NAME/RUN_NAME
